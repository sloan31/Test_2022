After six years of climbing I don't think I could ever name a single boulder as my absolute favorite. Every climb is unique <br>
and offers a new experience. Some boulder routes have exceptional movement. They allow the climber to enter a flow like state.<br>
Some have dynamic movements that require jumping to the next hold. Others have unique holds and structure. Most boulders are  in  <br>
beautiful settings and aesthically pleasing. No matter the route it's always an amazing experience that I never take for granted.<br>

Below are three of my favorite climbs. The first is named Alfalfa and is graded v5 in difficulty. It is a tall boulder with a unique <br>
feature. The rock is a beautiful grey and with black grainy streaks. The second is Finger Crack, located next to the Skykomish <br>
river. An amazing view and an aesthically pleasing boulder makes this a fantastic climb. The last boulder is named Lone Highway, <br>
a tall and proud line in Colorado.
