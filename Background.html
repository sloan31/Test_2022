I moved to Washington about two years ago from Colorado State Univeristy (CSU). I graduated from CSU in 2020 with a bachelors in <br>
Human Dimension of Natural Resources and a minor in Leadership. During this time I also worked as a teaching assistant, orienation leader,<br>
enviormental educator, and a site manager of a natural area. While at CSU I was able to foster and explore my passion for nature.

<br>
<br>

During this time I also found the sport of rock climbing. I joined the CSU climbing team and quickly found bouldering to be my favorite discpline.

<br>
Bouldering entails climbing rocks up to 20 feet with nothing but a pad below the boulder for protection.This allows the climber to move <br>
free and perform arcobatic moves. Though I competed in college I've always found climbing outside to be my favorite form of climbing.
